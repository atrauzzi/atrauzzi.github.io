style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><i>I tweeted the title of this blog post tonight and it got me to thinking about some of the encounters I have as a more or less polyglot developer who finds good and rewarding employment in PHP.</i></span><br />\n<br />\nI just finished attending the excellent and stimulating <a href=\"http://www.prairiedevcon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Praire Dev Con</a> 2015 this week. &nbsp;I'll let the web site speak for itself, but in summary it's a regional conference that attracts speakers from far and wide. &nbsp;For two days, men and women enjoy a brief glimpse of <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">professional-speaking disneyland</a>, returning home late in the evening and passing out from social and intellectual exhaustion.<br />\n<br />\nOne thing that many of my coworkers past and present have noted about this conference though is that it is very .NET centric. &nbsp;Now to me this is of course no discouragement at all. &nbsp;These are exciting (or possibly intimidating) times for many a Microsoft dev. &nbsp;I've discovered over the past few years that you can learn a lot from people who practice with tools and technologies different to your own.<br />\nFor those within my own circles however, I think they would feel more comfortable if the pool of experience hailed from a more diverse sampling of technologies.<br />\nThere are a few reasons for this, but I think the most prominent one is quite sad: It's actually very hard being a PHP developer at a conference. &nbsp;<b>Especially .NET ones.</b><br />\n<br />\n<i><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">Seriously, even the PERL guys take the occasional swipe.</span></i><br />\n<br />\nIf you take a general temperature check on PHP in any Microsoft circles, you may find that there is a strong tendency for people to look down their noses at anyone who self-identifies as a \"PHP developer\". &nbsp;It's as if even the very combination of the words \"PHP\" and \"developer\" raises their hackles.<br />\nWhich is oddly contradictory, because today we see recognition for nodejs, ruby and many other newer technologies from the .NET community. &nbsp;Languages that frankly even as a PHP developer, I have a strong distaste for because they are so blase about code structure, global state and mutability. &nbsp;But when it comes to PHP the policy is almost decisively still scorched earth!<br />\n<br />\nI don't know if this is because ASP never made headway into tag-soup. &nbsp;I don't know if it's because the \"M\" in LAMP ate all of Microsoft SQL's TCO babies. &nbsp;And I probably will never know if it's because 2006-2007-era efforts to win them over with free copies of Visual Studio was only done to prove that PHP developers were just a bunch of lost causes.<br />\n<br />\nWhat I do know is that it's 2015, Core CLR is now open source on github. &nbsp;ASP.NET is on github. &nbsp;Both projects are soliciting everything from commits, to suggestions, to drawings from peoples' children and homework questions.<br />\nIf nobody has done it yet, let me be the first person to welcome you to the brave world of free and open source cross platform development. &nbsp;I know some .NET developers have been using NuGet and were getting a small taste of this world.<br />\n<br />\nBut this is even more different still and before you get too much further, I would implore .NET as a community to do something about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexploded_ordnance\" target=\"_blank\">unexploded ordinance</a>&nbsp;left behind from a time when things were radically different. &nbsp;Certain&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/tbunio/pr-dc-2015-sql-server-is-cheaper-than-open-source\" target=\"_blank\">relic</a>&nbsp;ideals&nbsp;that fly in the face of reality and defy the successes of many that back then said <i>\"We don't believe you\"&nbsp;</i>-- and won.<br />\n<br />\nCertain sentiments that show the .NET community is prone to large pockets of stagnation and ignorance towards things outside of their bubble.<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<iframe

see this kind of yucking all too often.</span></i></div>\n<br />\nLet's be totally honest and set the record straight here: Everybody can win. &nbsp;.NET is getting runtime compilation, simplified project configuration, conventions, packages, cross platform and independence from IIS. &nbsp;PHP has <b>some</b> type hinting, closures, packages, traits and some strong OO advocates.<br />\n<br />\n<i><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">It's no big secret, I have complete language envy over C#. &nbsp;I wish I could have the environment of PHP with the capabilities of C#. &nbsp;The way things are going, it's starting to sound like I just might get that too! &nbsp;The difference is that I don't go around lampooning the people. &nbsp;No, I learn from your Scott Hanselmans, your Jeff Atwoods, your Greg Youngs and your Dino Espositos. &nbsp;But have you heard my Taylor Otwells, Fabien Potenciers,&nbsp;</span></i><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><i>Benjamin Eberleis and Jordi Boggianos?</i></span><br />\n<br />\nWhen I write PHP code, you'd be hard pressed to say you couldn't with minimal effort transpose it to some infrastructure-friendly C#. &nbsp;To say that the PHP I author is inferior is tantamount to making the same claim about yourself.<br />\nWe are converging and soon you won't be able to tell who is a cylon and who isn't - well - mostly. &nbsp;I may not wear a suit and my preferred topics of discussion outside of technology may offend your sensibilities. &nbsp;But would you believe that as a PHP developer I enjoy DDD, CQRS, onion architecture, [non]leaky abstractions, composition, conventions, strong typing, weak typing, closures, functional programming, unit of work, active record, repositories and POPO <span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">(POCO)</span> services...just as much as you do?<br />\n<br />\nJoin with the global community and shed some of the tired marketing and animosity from the old days. &nbsp;Don't be afraid to learn from PHP and admit the language <a href=\"http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-php-singularity/\" target=\"_blank\">got lots</a> <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=PHP%2C%20.NET%2C%20dotnet\" target=\"_blank\">of things</a> right.<br />\n<br />\nAnd for goodness sake, if you do really need to take a swing, have the professional courtesy to do it about <a href=\"https://wiki.php.net/rfc\" target=\"_blank\">current challenges</a>!"},"slug":"bandwagon-hatred-for-php","title":"Bandwagon Hatred for
