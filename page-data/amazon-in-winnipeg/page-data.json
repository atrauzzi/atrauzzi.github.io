The general influence of the industry is driving change around the world and any city that tries to take credit for that is probably too out of touch.</li>\n<li>Not all developers will work for my company. &nbsp;Not all developers can work for my company. &nbsp;Attracting talent to any city is an uphill battle facing constant attrition. I need to pick somewhere that can help me outpace that attrition.</li>\n<li>Quality, not quantity. Any developers I hire have to actually be good and understand how to write code that can be deployed and that can scale. &nbsp;Not code as-the-crow-flies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\nIntrospection</h3>\nLet's put aside the somewhat valid but all too common complaint about us having cold winters. &nbsp;Let's put aside our rapid transit and other infrastructure woes.<br />\n<br />\nI'm not sure if anyone has thought of this, but if you're more of a buy-local type, you should know that a company like Amazon would be ruinous to existing companies in the city. &nbsp;We can barely deal with pressure from Skip the Dishes and other national giants like iQmetrix.<br />\n<br />\nIf you want to talk about the talent pool, it's true that Winnipeg has produced some great software developers. Active discussions in local user groups here in Winnipeg are made up of a few of the most talented and vocal of them. &nbsp;The problem? &nbsp;The list of participants who are now expats continues to grow.<br />\nIdle chatter sometimes gets into how so few of the developers in Winnipeg actually treat their jobs as knowledge work. &nbsp;We are normalized to mistakes on a level that's considered common sense to avoid in the rest of the world. &nbsp;This gets to the <i>quality not quantity</i> point in my list above.<br />\n<br />\nCulturally, Winnipeg is a city that needs to get a lot better at being critical of itself and getting the right results. &nbsp;It's funny, as even a post like this will be seen by many as disloyal and blasphemous. &nbsp;But I'd ask those people to imagine themselves a few months from now after the decision is made and the dust has settled.<br />\n<br />\nIf I brought up everything I'm bringing up here again, would they, the mayor and premiere change their ways?<br />\n<br />\nI'm not holding out a hope.<br />\n<div>\n<br /></div>\nWe have an embarrassing history of commissioning fact-making studies, usually to serve the corruption in our municipal and provincial representation. &nbsp;We silence people who try to speak out and we bully people who try to raise our past mistakes as guides on how to act today. &nbsp;It's so bad, this cult like egoism and inertia serves as a point against Winnipeg in my previous section.<br />\n<br />\nIf Winnipeg was in the business of actually planning for the future, maybe our talk about being a good city for Amazon would be true. &nbsp;But to say that Winnipeg is a good candidate and deserving of their consideration is just attention-seeking dishonesty.<br />\n<br />\nWe've done nothing to deserve them."},"slug":"amazon-in-winnipeg","title":"Amazon in Winnipeg?","created":"2017-09-10T18:44:00.000Z","updated":"2017-09-11T11:33:47.000Z"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"amazon-in-winnipeg"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3220165301"]}
