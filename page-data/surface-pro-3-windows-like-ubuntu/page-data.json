Variety, right?<br />\n<br />\n<h3>\nExpectations</h3>\nIt's important that I still be able to do all the things I'm used to in Ubuntu. &nbsp;This means I need to be able to run the glut of development tools I'm interested in at any given moment, natively. &nbsp;No contrived virtual machine setups and complicated internal networks with host filesystem bridges and permission issues. &nbsp;I need to be able to type php, node or scala and get direct access to the tools.<br />\n<br />\nBecause Windows doesn't ship with any kind of package management and because <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Omega_/status/493033280758108162\" target=\"_blank\">chocolatey is not ready for prime time yet</a>, vendors don't have a clean way to centralize distribution and updates. &nbsp;This makes it very difficult to access open source packages the way you would on Ubuntu which is usually just a matter of calling apt-get with the occasional PPA having to be added.<br />\nOn most flavours of Linux, the packages are fully integrated into your system: Configuration, home directories, paths, alternative management and extensions - it's all going to be somewhere consistent.<br />\n<br />\nWindows doesn't have this wired up as nicely as Ubuntu or even Homebrew on OSX. &nbsp;So there's no real way to get the nice level of integration I listed above. &nbsp;But so long as I can run the tools, I'll live with having to manually manage them because for the most part - I don't have to or only have to do it once.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>\nInstalling Web Platforms</h3>\nMost people setting up PHP on a Windows or OSX machine will end up reaching for things like MAMP which are like the thermonuclear option. The integration is somewhat haphazard and while I applaud their efforts, I don't feel like it's going with the flow.<br />\nSo I dug a bit deeper and ended up discovering the very poorly promoted <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Web Platform Installer</a>. &nbsp;Inside it had builds of PHP all the way up to current versions of 5.5 and because it comes from Microsoft seems like a reliable canonical packaging. For Ubuntu readers, think of it like as if someone wrote a front end to apt, but only for web platform packages.<br />\n<br />\nIf there's one tool out of my whole experience that I could say merits much more discussion, it would be this. &nbsp;I feel like would be a very interesting starting point for a kind of \"Microsoft FOSS portal\". &nbsp;Not just for web platforms, but for databases, caching servers, libraries, web platform extensions/modules, and much more. &nbsp;It's actually thanks to this tool that I didn't abandon many of my efforts!<br />\n<br />\n<h3>\nConsole</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ConEmuTheWindowsTerminalConsolePromptWeveBeenWaitingFor.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Hanselman has already spoken about it</a>, but if you're looking to do anything in the console, go and install ConEmu right away. &nbsp;Be patient with the utterly overwhelming configuration options.<br />\n<br />\nYou will get everything you've wanted in a terminal on Windows including a dynamically resizable session and always-on text highlighting with copy/paste from keyboard shortcuts.<br />\n<br />\nSomething that I did play around with in the past was installing cygwin and having ConEmu fire up a bash session. &nbsp;There are a few things that don't always go perfectly from within a cygwin environment, but it was neat to feel like I was back in Linux. &nbsp;For the sake of keeping the system clean, I've chosen not to use it on my Surface.<br />\n<br />\nWhile you're at it, go ahead and install <a href=\"http://msysgit.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">msysgit</a>. &nbsp;It is the git implementation you are looking for.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>\nPretty Things</h3>\nPart of using Windows is of course the eye candy of the 8.1 desktop. You may not be a fan of Metro and prefer your ye olde start menu junk drawer. &nbsp;But when I saw the Windows 8 interface for the first time, it was refreshing and novel. &nbsp;As a side note, if you've ever worked with Microsoft's push notifications, they're kind of fun in terms of what kind of functionality they make available as a baseline.<br />\n<br />\nThere are a few good apps in the app store, but what's obviously missing is anything google-related. They've seemingly decided to skip the Windows 8 ecosystem (for now?) - but that doesn't mean you're left without recourse. &nbsp;So go ahead and install Chrome like you normally would, except if you haven't already, start adding apps via the Chrome Store.<br />\n<br />\nI'm particularly fond of Postman REST Client, Google Play Music and of course Gmail. &nbsp;The trick however is to then go to the view that lists all the large icons for your apps and do this:<br />\n<table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody>\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LVRAa9wD0AE/U9xgPePsQsI/AAAAAAAATyc/6g4Uy4MGKzc/s1600/Chrome+Create+Shortcut.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LVRAa9wD0AE/U9xgPePsQsI/AAAAAAAATyc/6g4Uy4MGKzc/s1600/Chrome+Create+Shortcut.png\" height=\"320\" width=\"281\" /></a></td></tr>\n<tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Create a shortcut for Chrome apps!</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<br />\nThat will pin them to your taskbar and give them their own context to run in, which really kinda blends in all the features of ChromeOS into your Windows install. &nbsp;No more pinning and juggling your \"always on tabs\". &nbsp;Your browser just goes back to being a browser. &nbsp;You can also enable the Chrome launcher if for some reason you think it's worthwhile.<br />\n<i><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">(I should also remark that when you're in Ubuntu, if you go to the web interface for OneNote, you can pin it as an app to your taskbar.)</span></i><br />\n<br />\nOkay, some of these have been pretty obvious, but I think people forget that you can combine all this functionality together on Windows. &nbsp;So for someone like me who has every reason to want to enjoy a Surface tablet without having to circumvent it, <b><u>I actually can</u></b>!<br />\n<br />\n<h3>\nIDEs and Viewers</h3>\nUnless you're developing Microsoft stuff, JetBrains makes the IDE you want. &nbsp;However be sure to install Sublime so that you're not wrestling with line endings when editing configs and viewing logs.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://robomongo.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Robomongo</a>, <a href=\"http://redisdesktop.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Redis Desktop Manager</a> and <a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/\" target=\"_blank\">MySQL Workbench</a> come highly recommended and are also available for Ubuntu and OSX. &nbsp;I would not be caught dead without those tools.<br />\n<i><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">(For those of you on Ubuntu, I also recommend trying them out with <a href=\"https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/gstm/\" target=\"_blank\">GSTM</a> which allows you to easily set up tunnels to your live servers.)</span></i><br />\n<br />\nAlso, do check out SourceTree. &nbsp;It's available for OSX, but is arguably more integral on Windows. &nbsp;The visuals are also a great way to get a firmer grasp on the git terminology and what it all actually means.<br />\n<h3>\nOther Stuff</h3>\nSo, I've really only spoken about web platforms and some Chrome integrations, but what about Java, Scala, MongoDB, node.js, redis, MySQL and other tools? &nbsp;Well, believe it or not, they're all pretty well handled by the respective vendors. &nbsp;The trick is similar to what I did when trying to get a sane PHP install for my IDEs to recognize: Look for an official Microsoft build of the project, then MSI, then EXE, and then if all else fails get an archive of the statically built software and create a directory in Program Files for it. This is the case for redis and MongoDB where I feel like they could be making things a bit easier on Windows. <br />\n<br />\nHowever this is also where that Microsoft Web Platform Installer or some equivalent could come to the rescue. &nbsp;In those circumstances, Microsoft has every reason to step in and integrate a build of the project with the operating system, further cementing their commitment to FOSS on Windows.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>\nConclusion</h3>\nSo, am I doing development on my Surface Pro 3 in such a fashion that I have established on my other two Ubuntu-running laptops? <br />\nI think only just as of today, <i>yes, I am</i>. &nbsp;It's taken a bit of figuring out after being away from Windows as a main programming driver for such a long time. &nbsp;But I have been able to use PHP's built in server to host Laravel and connect to my machine's MongoDB database and everything appears to be working. &nbsp;I was able to install grunt, bower and stylus to download and build my static front end git submodule. &nbsp;Which is a pretty good litmus test considering all the moving parts in there (git submodules, node, npm, PHP MongoDB .dll and php.ini config).<br />\n<br />\nWould I consider developing on Windows to be superior to developing on Ubuntu? &nbsp;As I stated earlier: <i>No</i>. &nbsp;While I don't have that Windows-is-unnatural feeling anymore - like as if everything is abstracted - I feel like it took a lot of manual effort and configuration just to get everything in place. &nbsp;Part of why I wrote this blog post is so that I would have somewhere to come back to if I ever had to do it again!<br />\n<br />\nThat said, I do have a very nice Haswell Dell XPS 15 with a QHD+ touch screen running Ubuntu with me and I haven't thrown my hands up and switched over yet. &nbsp;Not to prove a point either, my Surface Pro is growing on me like an accessory might. &nbsp;Not just as a tablet/ultrabook hybrid, but as an entire package. &nbsp;Battery life, switching from tablet to ultrabook mode, visuals, that personal feeling... Yeah, I know, it's weird - I don't think any of the enthusiasm Panos Panay had for this device during it's launch was insincere.<br />\n<br />\nSo, in closing - I remain totally confident that if Microsoft took the price down $200 - $300 (the higher up you go) across the board and included the keyboards, these things would flood the streets. &nbsp;There is just too much untapped appeal for them not to succeed.<br />\n<br />\nThe Surface Pro 3 has lots of different micro-personalities that reveal themselves to you as you use it. &nbsp;As an always-on developer, this actually has resulted in increased productivity for me!"},"slug":"surface-pro-3-windows-like-ubuntu","title":"Surface Pro 3 - Windows like Ubuntu","created":"2014-08-02T04:35:00.000Z","updated":"2014-08-02T04:35:32.000Z"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"surface-pro-3-windows-like-ubuntu"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3220165301"]}
