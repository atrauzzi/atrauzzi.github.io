I had everything I needed to succeed in both spaces. I could either download everything for free or I had complete access to a set of MSDN discs in a binder with a cover like this:<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zgkH5ReEZF0/V1NAe3GJ-aI/AAAAAAAAjNU/SaUFbin75SQk4-w31lC_tMDY3quEsSnqQCLcB/s1600/MSDN_Subscription_Binder-lo.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"235\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zgkH5ReEZF0/V1NAe3GJ-aI/AAAAAAAAjNU/SaUFbin75SQk4-w31lC_tMDY3quEsSnqQCLcB/s400/MSDN_Subscription_Binder-lo.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<br /></div>\nIf I wanted to build ASP scripts that spoke to Access or SQL databases, it wouldn't have been a problem. &nbsp;In some ways, I even tried, installing all the tools and trying out the environments. Each time however, I abandoned the effort because I felt like I couldn't tinker my way into it.<br />\nSo, Instead I ended up choosing the open source route because the community was open and it was easy to learn via examples on the internet.<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">(Despite being long before Stack Overflow, one could have pretty decent luck with searches on PHP topics at the time.)</span><br />\n<br />\nThe reason I went that way was because much of the Microsoft philosophy back then was to hide knowledge behind courses, certifications and licenses. &nbsp;To make matters worse, an even higher proportion of people in the community were <a href=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">dark matter developers</a>!&nbsp; I had no mentor, high schools were a few years away from becoming tech savvy and I was just a teenager trying to impress himself at home in a smaller prairie city.<br />\n<br />\nFrom 1998 to 2016, the primary ecosystem I've coded with and had demonstrable results and experience with has been PHP.<br />\nThat didn't mean however that I didn't stay curious about alternatives. I've toyed with Ruby, Python and Java at various stages or for school assignments. &nbsp;JavaScript is obviously there and I even played a bit with Scala. PHP matured considerably as a language through the years and so did I with it, adopting new best practices and eventually frameworks.<br />\n<br />\n<hr />\n<br />\nMicrosoft for the longest time has been subject to considerable derision because they just couldn't keep up with an economy of software that was&nbsp;<b><u>literally</u>&nbsp;<u>free</u></b>. &nbsp;Their attitudes towards the people promoting and using their products was considered to be toxic and until&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/ballmer-steps-down-from-microsoft-board-1408472336\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Ballmer resigned</a>, there seemed to be no end in sight.<br />\nOnly after almost 20 years do I think it's finally become safe to consider the things from out of Redmond lately.<br />\n<br />\nI've landed a great local opportunity recently where I've been able to start developing 9-5 using C#. &nbsp;Owing to the fact that I'm always keeping up with technologies outside of my comfort zone, it's a transition I've been able to make without too much upset.<br />\nIt did however give me a thought that it would be neat to document the subtle differences between the technology, culture and approaches to problem solving. &nbsp;At least so long as the observations remain interesting or useful.<br />\n<br />\nI've got a few blog posts already lined up for this mini series, barring a few more edits. &nbsp;I'll try to get them out in the next little while, but I'd like to leave you with one thought: For what it's worth, if ever you've been told to not put all your eggs in one basket, let me tell you: That is&nbsp;<i>damned good</i> advice when it comes to tech skills."},"slug":"from-php-to-asp-net-introduction","title":"From PHP to ASP.net - Introduction","created":"2016-06-20T12:21:00.000Z","updated":"2016-06-20T12:21:06.000Z"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"from-php-to-asp-net-introduction"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3220165301"]}
